    <p>I am a dynamic figure, often seen creating fake
        emails to get more free trials and preaching
        Communism to Icelandic sheep herders. Sometimes,
        if you're lucky, you'll even see me erecting massive 500
        story skyscrapers in my backyard. When I am bored, I charm
        cats with my godlike yodelling skills and my
        transcendental clarinet squeaks.</p>

    <p>I am motivated to take risks. Sometimes, because I like
        to live dangerously, I play chess with one less pawn
        and do geometry in pen. Sometimes I even
        play on the Wii without the safety strap! I know
        - I'm a real daredevil. Sometimes I'm even amazed myself
        that I've managed to survive this long in the first
        place, what with all these totally dangerous and not
        at all normal feats! But nothing quite beats the
        adrenaline rush that I get from participating in a class
        discussion.</p>
